## 1. Introduction

With the advent of quantum computing, the landscape of cybersecurity is poised for a significant transformation. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, such as BB84 and E91, provide theoretically secure communication channels based on the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the practical implementation of these protocols is hindered by various technical challenges, including the need for maintaining extremely low temperatures for quantum systems. Recently, a significant breakthrough in the field of superconductors has emerged with the synthesis of a room-temperature superconductor, LK-99. This superconductor operates at ambient pressure, providing a promising infrastructure for the practical implementation of quantum computing and QKD.

This paper seeks to analyze the potential enhancements in the cybersecurity space through the use of room-temperature superconductors like LK-99 in QKD protocols. We present a comparative analysis of major QKD protocols and discuss their potential enhancements with the use of LK-99. Our study contributes to the ongoing discourse on quantum cybersecurity, providing a comprehensive understanding of how recent advancements in superconductors can bolster the implementation of secure QKD protocols.

## 2. Quantum Key Distribution

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a quantum communication method that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to secure the distribution of cryptographic keys. This revolutionary method allows two parties to generate a secret key that can be used for secure communication, with the guarantee that any eavesdropping would be detected.

The primary advantage of QKD over traditional key distribution methods is its ability to detect eavesdroppers. If an eavesdropper tries to measure the quantum states being transmitted, this measurement will disturb the quantum states due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and can be detected by the communicating parties.

QKD protocols such as BB84, proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, and E91, proposed by Ekert in 1991, are among the most well-known and widely studied. The BB84 protocol uses two sets of orthogonal quantum states, while the E91 protocol uses entangled pairs of quantum states, taking advantage of the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics to create a secret key.

In this study, we focus on these two QKD protocols and analyze their potential enhancements with the use of room-temperature superconductors.

## 3. Room-Temperature Superconductors

Superconductors are materials that can conduct electricity without any resistance when cooled below a certain critical temperature (Tc). Traditionally, superconductors required cooling to extremely low temperatures, making them impractical for many applications. However, the recent discovery of a room-temperature superconductor, LK-99, has opened up new possibilities in the field of quantum computing and quantum information science.

LK-99 is a modified lead-apatite structure that exhibits superconductivity at room temperature (Tc ≥ 400K, 127°C) and ambient pressure. Its superconductivity has been proven through various measures, including Critical temperature (Tc), Zero-resistivity, Critical current (Ic), Critical magnetic field (Hc), and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), which is caused by Cu2+ substitution of Pb2+ ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate.

This structural change generates stress and results in distortion of the cylindrical column interface, creating superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The unique structure of LK-99 allows the minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces, which is the most crucial factor in maintaining and exhibiting superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.

The emergence of room-temperature superconductors like LK-99 has significant implications for quantum computing and quantum information science. In the following sections, we will explore the potential enhancements in Quantum Key Distribution protocols through the use of room-temperature superconductors.

## 4. Comparative Analysis of QKD Protocols

In the realm of quantum cryptography, BB84 and E91 protocols stand as two of the most prominent Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols. Both protocols leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure secure communication, albeit through different mechanisms.

### 4.1. BB84 Protocol

The BB84 protocol, proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, is the first and one of the most widely used QKD protocols. It employs two sets of orthogonal quantum states to encode the key bits. The security of BB84 stems from the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, which asserts that an unknown quantum state cannot be precisely copied. Consequently, any attempt by an eavesdropper to intercept and clone the quantum states will inevitably introduce detectable errors in the communication.

From a cybersecurity perspective, the BB84 protocol offers robust security guarantees. However, its efficiency is contingent upon the quality of the quantum channel and the error rate. High error rates can significantly reduce the final key rate, as more key bits need to be sacrificed for error correction and privacy amplification.

### 4.2. E91 Protocol

The E91 protocol, proposed by Ekert in 1991, is another pivotal QKD protocol that utilizes entangled pairs of quantum states. Unlike BB84, E91 exploits the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics and Bell's theorem to create a secret key and detect eavesdropping. If an eavesdropper attempts to measure the entangled states, it will disturb these correlations and can be detected by testing Bell's inequalities.

The E91 protocol provides a different set of security guarantees compared to BB84. It allows for the detection of eavesdropping without sacrificing key bits, potentially leading to higher final key rates in the presence of eavesdropping. However, the practical implementation of E91 is more challenging due to the requirement of generating and managing entangled quantum states.

### 4.3. Comparative Analysis

Both BB84 and E91 offer robust security under the laws of quantum mechanics. However, they differ in terms of practical implementation and efficiency. BB84, with its simpler single quantum state preparation and measurement, is easier to implement and typically more efficient in terms of key generation rate. On the other hand, E91, despite its more complex setup, has the potential advantage of higher final key rates in the presence of eavesdropping and compatibility with quantum repeaters for long-distance quantum communication.

In the context of room-temperature superconductors, both protocols could potentially benefit from improved efficiency and practicality. Room-temperature superconductors like LK-99 could facilitate the generation, transmission, and detection of quantum states, thereby enhancing the performance of both BB84 and E91 protocols. However, further research and reproduction of LK-99 are needed to fully explore and realize these potential benefits.

## 5. Potential Enhancements with Room-Temperature Superconductors on BB84 & E91

The advent of room-temperature superconductors, such as LK-99, heralds a new era of possibilities for quantum computing and communication, in particular, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols. The two protocols we focus on, BB84 and E91, exhibit unique operational characteristics and hence, are expected to benefit from room-temperature superconductors in different ways.

### BB84 Enhancements

BB84, owing to its reliance on single quantum state preparation and measurement, stands to gain significantly from the application of room-temperature superconductors like LK-99. Superconductors are characterized by their zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields, phenomena collectively known as the Meissner effect. These characteristics could streamline quantum state operations, enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of state preparation and measurement. Consequently, this would lead to a reduction in the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and an enhancement in the Secure Key Rate (SKR).

### E91 Enhancements

Conversely, E91 employs entangled quantum states, a more complex but potentially more robust system under eavesdropping. Room-temperature superconductors, due to their potential to offer improved coherence times and reduced environmental noise, could significantly bolster the efficacy of E91. The maintenance of entanglement is contingent upon the coherence of quantum states; hence, the lessened decoherence offered by superconductors would lead to a decrease in QBER and an increase in SKR.

To visualize these potential enhancements, we formulated a hypothetical model based on plausible assumptions that align with the principles of quantum mechanics and superconductivity. Our model projects a 20% reduction in QBER and a corresponding 20% increase in SKR for BB84, with the introduction of room-temperature superconductors. For E91, given its intricate reliance on quantum entanglement, we anticipate a more pronounced 30% reduction in QBER and a 30% increase in SKR.

These projected improvements are depicted in Figure 1, which illustrates the changes in QBER and SKR across different communication distances for both BB84 and E91 protocols, before and after the hypothetical implementation of room-temperature superconductors.

While these projections provide an exciting glimpse into the potential benefits of room-temperature superconductors, it's critical to underscore that these are preliminary, hypothetical models. They represent the first steps towards a more nuanced understanding of the transformative potential of room-temperature superconductors, such as LK-99, in quantum computing and communication. The actual impact of these superconductors on QKD protocols, and the broader landscape of quantum computing, will be the focus of rigorous future research and empirical validation.

## 6. Implications for Space Travel and Advanced Technologies

The advent of room-temperature superconductors, such as LK-99, has the potential to instigate revolutionary advancements in a variety of fields, notably space travel and a myriad of advanced technologies.

1. **Space Communication:** Quantum communication protocols enhanced with room-temperature superconductors could provide secure, long-range communication in space, overcoming the limitations of classical methods. For instance, quantum entanglement could allow for instantaneous communication, mitigating the delays currently experienced due to vast interstellar distances.

2. **Navigation and Timing Systems:** Quantum technology for navigation and timing systems, supported by superconductors, could exploit quantum entanglement and superposition to achieve remarkable accuracy. For example, a quantum compass, which does not rely on GPS signals, could utilize entangled photons to measure the Earth's magnetic field with unparalleled precision, thereby enabling precise navigation in deep space.

3. **Propulsion Systems:** The zero electrical resistance of superconductors could potentially be leveraged for the development of highly efficient propulsion systems. For instance, magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters, which rely on Lorentz forces to generate thrust, could be made more efficient and compact with the use of superconducting magnets.

4. **Energy Storage:** Room-temperature superconductors could significantly enhance the capacity and efficiency of energy storage systems, a critical aspect of long-duration space travel. Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) systems, which store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil, could be used to provide the high levels of power necessary for advanced propulsion technologies.

## 7. Conclusion
